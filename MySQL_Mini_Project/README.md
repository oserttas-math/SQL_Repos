# Mini-Project : SQL 
My solution to SQL assignment. I first downloaded data from the remote database and created my local database using MySQL Workbench. Then I connected to my local database which is named by `my_db` from Jupyter Notebook using SQLAlchemy connecting strings to be able execute SQL queries. 

# Learning Objective
  - Work with SQL-based databases 
  - Learn and write basic SQL queries up to basic aggregations and joins
  - Comment on SQL code
# Notes
- Required Python package to run SQL commands from Jupyter Notebook is  `pip instal ipython-sql`. [Source](https://pypi.org/project/ipython-sql/)
